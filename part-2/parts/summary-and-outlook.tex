\chapter{Project Analysis and Outlook}\label{chap:summaryAndOutlook}

To actually learn and take away as much as possible after nine month of development on such a big project like Unplagged we believe that thoroughly analyzing the course of the project and most importantly the mistakes is really important. The problem with this is always that there are some kind of \enquote{politics} involved, because we as a team and also every team member for themselves have an agenda when doing this. We are not graded yet, so we still want to shine with our achievements and not everybody in the team will feel the same about every topic that will or could be mentioned here. So this just as a disclaimer beforehand. 

We will nonetheless try to do our best in constructively critizing ourselves and look at what worked well in this chapter. Additonally we will give an outlook on improvements and further possible developments of the project.

\section{Project Analysis}

\subsection{Using a Wiki}

One of the things that we were asked to do at the beginning was to maintain a Wiki, which we created inside our project management tool Redmine. Looking at the state of it now, we have to say, that this didn't work very well. 

We currently have 62 pages in there, with probably one third of them coming from meeting minutes and the rest simply being not very well written or up to date and therfore not useful, with just very few exceptions.

Starting it worked OK, but the information we put on there wasn't valid long enough in most instances, because our perception of the topics changed very often in the beginning, which means the motivation and effort needed to keep the information relevant didn't match the usefulness. It was simply easier and even necessary after a while to ask the person that wrote the article or was currently working on that area of the system about it, because by the article you couldn't really tell if the information was still holding true. As we were just five people and mostly knew what the others worked on this was the path of least resistance and was adopted pretty quickly.

It also was problematic that we had just five editors for other reasons. As we could have put an endless amout of articles on the wiki, it often wasn't the case that someone wrote an article that then was corrected by someone else, but more that it stayed the way it was written, because the others were hopefully busy writing something about another topic, but maybe didn't even notice that there was something new. This lead to some kind of sprial of fewer and fewer edits, because when it didn't look like something was happening, the enticement of making edits was also reduced.

To make it work we believe that at least some good experiences of the eventual editors with working on wikis would be helpful, because with a group of just five people, everybody has to be dedicated to keep it running. Maybe making the decision to use a wiki more optional would also help, because it's simply harder to work on something, when the usefulness wasn't discovered but the necessity got kind of \enquote{enforced} from outside of the team.


\subsection{Agile development}

All in all the agile process we figured out after a while worked pretty good and is something that everyone of us feels more comfortable using now, so doing this helped us a lot experience wise. 

A problem we had with it is, that it took us really a while to pick up steam with this process. We are not quite sure if it also has something to do with the growing pressure to deliver something working in the end or most of us finally being comfortable with the development environment, but the sprints we did worked much more efficiently from the start of the second project semester.

What we feel is, that starting a bit earlier with coding could have helped the overall progress a lot, because the research of nearly one and a half month at the start where we didn't code, would probalby have been more useful when we would have done it more along the way.

\subsection{User Interface}

One of the points that was mentioned in the project description(see page \ref{cite:projectDescription}) was to put an emphasize on the usability and to test with \enquote{*Plaggers}.

other courses/work really break the flow of the project
